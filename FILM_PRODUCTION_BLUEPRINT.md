## ACT-BY-ACT BREAKDOWN

### ACT 1: THE ABYSS (0:00 - 1:15)

**Visual Concept:** A man at rock bottom, surrounded by the remnants of his failed business.

**Scene Sequence:**
1. **Opening Shot (0:00-0:15):** Extreme close-up of cracked mirror reflecting the hero's eye. Slow zoom. The cracks symbolize his shattered dreams.

3. **The Weight (0:45-1:15):** Hero walks through rain-soaked streets at night. Blue-tinted lighting. Slow motion. Water droplets on camera lens.

**Cinematography Techniques:**
- Shallow depth of field isolating the subject

- Slow dolly movements creating unease
- Macro lens for emotional detail shots

**Voice-Over (Arabic with Tashkeel):**
> "لَقَدْ فَقَدْتُ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ. حَتَّى الأَمَلُ أَصْبَحَ عِبْئًا ثَقِيلًا عَلَى كَاهِلِي."

**Sound Design:**
